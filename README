Ticker jQuery plugin

Continuous ticker that can scroll horizontally, left to right or right to left
Can also scroll vertically, top to bottom or bottom to top

Tried to keep css and html dependencies minimal, so you don't have to write much
CSS and set up HTML.

Options to set the following:
* Height
* Width
* Speed
* Scroll direction

Only tested with jQuery 1.7
